# BayKernel
An operating system kernel.

## Dependencies
`ninja`, `nasm`, `gcc` and `cat`.
For running you can use `qemu` or `bochs`.

### Note: All the dependencies must be maximally up-to-date, especially
`nasm` and `ninja`. If your distro doesn't have up-to-date versions, compile them from source.
They are quite small.
